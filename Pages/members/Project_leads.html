                        <a href="#" class="btn btn-primary" role="button" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="auto" data-trigger="focus" title="Lynne Nethken" data-content="Lynne Nethken is currently pursuing a Masters of Science in Mechanical Engineering at Arizona State University’s School for Engineering of Matter, Transport, and Energy. Prior to earning her BSE in Engineering, Lynne worked for ten years in the healthcare industry holding various positions in administration and management. From this, she learned important leadership and teaming skills, professionalism for interacting with consumers and clients, finance, and marketing. Upon returning to school, she attended the Polytechnic School at Arizona State University to earn a Bachelor of Science in Engineering with a concentration in Robotics, which allowed her to apply her leadership skills to more challenging projects such as the SpaceX Hyperloop Competition. 

                        Through the Polytechnic School's hands-on, team-centered, and project-based curriculum, she was exposed to a diverse background of engineering studies to include electrical, mechanical, software, and controls. To highlight just a few of her undergraduate projects, she was the Project Manager for the EcoCAR 3 Competition during its initialization phase, she helped to developed a robotic glove for teaching ASL to the hearing impaired and a machine-vision based sense and response device that allows the visually impaired more safely navigate their environments. For her senior capstone project, she helped Orbital ATK develop a cost-effective flight systems data recorder for space-applications. Lynne graduated Summa Cum Laude with a 3.92 GPA in May of 2016 and received the Outstanding Undergraduate Award for her exemplary academic performance and excellence in research and community outreach to leave a lasting and beneficial impact on the Fulton Schools community as well as Arizona and elsewhere.

                        Lynne currently serves as the Team Captain and Project Lead for AZLoop, directing an interscholastic and multidisciplinary team of over seventy students from various engineering and business disciplines. She also is a member of the Controls Modeling and Simulation team, of which she is responsible for building a control model for the Pod’s stability mechanisms using Matlab, Simulink, and Stateflow. During Hyperloop’s Competition I, Lynne was the Controls Subteam Lead for the ASU Polytechnic School team, which was responsible for the design and implementation of an active control system for Emergency Mitigation and Stability.

                        When not in class or leading the AZLoop team, Lynne spends her time traveling to her favorite beaches, enjoying outdoor adventures, and taking her telescope to the nearest dark skies for astrophotography. ">Learn More</a>

Fulton Schools of Engineering at Arizona State University Polytechnic Campus. He is very active in student organizations and clubs.  He is the president of the Rossum Rumblers Robotics Club as well as Co-Captain of AZLoop: Arizona’s SpaceX Hyperloop Competition Team. He is also active in the Arizona entrepreneurship community.  He is the CEO and Co-Owner of 3dCycler LLC. 
                        Josh regularly volunteers his time and energy at Pioneer Preparatory Academy, a Title1 Elementary School in MaryVale an underprivileged area of Phoenix, AZ.   The students that he serves have little to no exposure to stem fields, despite their obvious and unwavering passion for the content. 
                        He has won the UNL New global Venture competition, the Downtown Phoenix “Just Start: Launch Day” competition, earned a spot on the Edson Entrepreneurship Initiative Cohort, the ASU Thomas M. Prescott Entrepreneurship Fellows and the University Innovation Fellowship. Josh is also a BSA Eagle Scout. 
                        He has led teams to win many hackathons and competitions including MSH, Intel “Code for Good” 2014, Hackster Hardware weekend, Global Game Jam Phoenix 2013 and place in many others such as the TechShop Hardware Cup.  He is the recipient of the “2015 Undergraduate Student Engagement Award” as well as the Ira A. Fulton Schools of Engineering SOAR “Outstanding Community Builder Award”.
                        Prior to attending ASU, Josh worked as a music teacher and preschool teacher as well as a custom pool and spa designer and technician. He spends some of his free time mentoring other students who are interested in furthering their ventures.  To inspire his fellow colleagues and pay his experiences forwards, he began a new club at ASU called the “Startup Slam Organization” This organization serves to unite entrepreneurs across campus and provide feedback and support as they begin their various endeavors.  
                        Josh is married to Shilo Patchin and they are expecting their first child in early January, 2016.  In his free time, he likes to go mountain biking, run in obstacle course races such as the Spartan Sprint, playing new board games with his friends and designing and building 3d Printers.
                        Josh is very passionate about building and designing systems to make the world a better place, and after graduating, would like to start an engineering firm aimed at producing and implementing technologies to improve the lives of people around the world. ">Learn More</a>
